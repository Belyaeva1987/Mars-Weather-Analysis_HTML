# Mars-Weather-Analysis_HTML

This project represents full web-scraping and data analysis project. Information needed for analysis was extracted via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.
The data was analyzed to answer the following questions: 
    * How many months exist on Mars? 
    * How many Martian days' worth of data are there? 
    * The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, and a data visualization was created to support each answer: 
    * Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest? 
    * Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest? 
    * How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made. 
    * The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file.
